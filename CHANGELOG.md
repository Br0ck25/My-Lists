## [Unreleased]
- **Performance:** Fixed account login and navigation lag for accounts with 1000+ items in Watch History by caching parsed tracking payloads in memory (`_memoryCustomListsObj`) and eliminating repetitive main-thread JSON string re-parsing.
- **Fix:** Fixed a runtime crash in `loadCreatorSync` (`ReferenceError: localOnly is not defined`) during tracking sync unpack.
- **Performance:** Restored 0ms instant tab switching and in-memory Discover feeds caching (`_discoverFeedsCache`), matching production smoothness.
- **Fix:** Enhanced `compactCustomListMap` storage compaction to permanently eliminate browser `QuotaExceededError` when saving large accounts.
- **Feature:** Improved list search with external source name search (MDBList, Trakt, TMDB, Simkl, Profile, Streaming), external creator username search, multi-token relevance scoring, and source badges.
- **Fix:** Fixed Mark Season Watched button state resetting on refresh and fixed episode checkmarks lingering after clicking Mark Season Unwatched.
- **UI:** Renamed "Creator Profile" to "Profile" across all user-facing interface text, prompts, alerts, and FAQs.
- **Fix:** Fixed browser refresh on Custom Lists returning user to the "My Lists" tab page or dropping items.
- **Fix:** Fixed Continue Watching "See All" items disappearing upon clicking the browser refresh button.
- **Fix:** Fixed Continue Watching fast queue race condition (adding both watchHistory and continueWatching to creatorscrobblequeue).
- **Fix:** Fixed Plex scrobbles using show poster instead of episode still thumbnail in Watch History.

- **Fix:** Plex & Nuvio Continue Watching progression and Plex watched checkmarks.
  - Resolved Continue Watching progression failure: fixed a server-merge race condition in `/api/creator/sync/save-tracking` where incoming browser tracking syncs were overwriting the server's newly computed next episodes with stale client state.
  - Fixed Plex TMDB resolution: fixed a title search nesting bug in `fetchTmdbItemDetailsUncached` that caused non-IMDb Plex scrobbles to fail metadata lookup.
  - Added Creator TMDB Key resolution for Plex webhook handler (`handleMediaServerScrobble`).
  - Enhanced client-side episode watch status checks (`openEpisodeDetails`, `computeWatchBadgeState`) to support composite and title-based fallback IDs.

- **Fix:** Plex re-watch progression and TMDB API usage caching.
  - Added watch history reduction logic to Plex scrobbling (previously only on Nuvio) to accurately handle re-watching old episodes without accidentally reverting your Continue Watching state backwards.
  - Rewired TMDB requests to utilize Cloudflare's native Edge Cache API (`caches.default`) in addition to KV. External TMDB requests were bypassing edge caching on Cloudflare Free/Pro tiers, leading to intense TMDB rate-limiting (and inflated API usage stats in the admin dashboard) which previously caused Continue Watching updates to silently fail.

- **Fix:** Continue Watching next episode updates for Plex and Nuvio.
  - Fixed a string coercion bug when reducing watch history that caused the system to mistakenly fetch the next episode for the *first* watched episode rather than the *latest* one.
  - Added a fallback safety check: if a show's next episode cannot be fetched from TMDB (due to rate limits, server timeouts, or metadata agent mismatches from Plex), the previous Continue Watching state is now safely restored rather than permanently dropping the show.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-08-31

### 🛠️ Sync & Live Preview Fixes
- **Watch Tracking Sync Debounce Accumulation**:
  - Fixed a race condition in `scheduleTrackingSync` where concurrent UI events wiped out the `intentionalRemoval` flag, causing unwatched episodes/seasons/shows and removed Continue Watching/Watch History items to revert after <1 second.
  - Ensured `toggleWatchStatus`, `toggleBatchWatchStatus`, and `dismissContinueWatchingShow` pass the intentional removal flag to permanently remove items in server KV.
- **Airing Next Multi-ID Deduplication**:
  - Captures canonical `tmdbId` to prevent the same upcoming episode from showing multiple times when Watch History stores mixed ID formats (`tt...`, `tmdb:...`).
- **Continue Watching Cross-Format Show Deduplication**:
  - Enhanced `dedupeContinueWatchingItems` to deduplicate shows across different ID formats using normalized show titles as a fallback.
- **Live Preview & Catalog Flashing Prevention**:
  - Added configuration payload hashing in `loadCreatorSync` to prevent tearing down the `#lists` DOM when only timestamps change during periodic background syncs.
  - Updated `renderLivePreview` to preserve existing posters during background data refreshes instead of clearing them out with shimmer skeletons.
- **Creator Sync Foreground Resume Crash Fix**:
  - Fixed runtime `ReferenceError: opts is not defined` crash in `loadCreatorSync`.
- **Large Account Performance Optimization**:
  - Removed 15-second forced full-page re-renders and stopped hidden tabs from generating thousands of image DOM nodes.
- **Continue Watching Badges & Parity Rules**:
  - Enforced complete mirroring between **Your Custom Lists > Continue Watching** and **Catalogs / Live Preview**:
    - **Newest Season**: Episode 1 displays `Season Premiere` (if unaired); middle episodes (2 to N-1) display `Finale: [Date]` (e.g. *Lanterns S01E02* `Finale: Oct 4`, *Reacher S04E02* `Finale: Sep 16`); final episode displays `Season Finale`. Unaired episodes display their upcoming air date badge.
    - **Older Seasons** (e.g. *Tracker S03E01*, *FBI S01E03*, *Reacher S03E01*): Displays no badges when the newest season is a later season.
  - Fixed `ReferenceError: today is not defined` in `isEpisodeAired` (`19_client-search-and-likes.js`) and resolved a syntax error in `22_client-creator-profile.js`.
  - Fixed poster card matching in `livePreviewPosterHtml` so Continue Watching badges in Catalogs / Live Preview mirror Your Custom Lists.
  - Enhanced `refreshAiringNext` to auto-fetch when local items are empty, preventing stalled schedule displays on startup.
  - Expanded server-side Airing Next evaluation limit (Trakt/Simkl/MDBList) from 35-40 up to 90 candidate shows, ensuring all upcoming episodes populate in Live Preview & Editor catalogs.
  - Fixed a massive HTTP 429 rate-limit bug when clicking "Mark all as Watched" on Trakt/Simkl/MDBList history, which previously attempted to redundantly sync thousands of items individually back to external providers.
  - Added an in-memory fallback for Custom Lists that completely bypasses the browser's 5MB `localStorage` limit for logged-in users, seamlessly syncing massive imported lists (8,000+ items) directly to/from the cloud. Offline/unauthenticated users now see a proper "Storage Full" error instead of a silent failure.
  - Added automated retry logic for Continue Watching updates during mass imports to prevent TMDB rate limits (110 of 111 shows failing), and fixed the "run this again" button so it actually retries fetching Continue Watching data even if the watch history is already imported.
  - Fixed a "Zombie" item bug where deleting a show from Continue Watching (or Watch History) and immediately refreshing the page would cause the item to re-appear due to Cloudflare KV propagation delays.
  - Fixed a bug where episodes scrobbled from external Media Servers (Plex, Emby, Jellyfin) would appear in Watch History but fail to show the "Marked as Watched" checkmark when browsing the show's seasons in the UI, and added backwards-compatibility so your existing scrobbles now display correctly.
  - Fixed a race condition where massive Trakt imports (8,000+ items) would vanish if the browser was refreshed immediately after importing, due to Cloudflare KV propagation delays overwriting the volatile RAM fallback; massive lists now correctly fallback to `sessionStorage` to safely survive page reloads.

  - Fixed variable scope issue in server-side TMDB details handler that caused `/api/details` to return 404 for series.
  - Enhanced client-side poster click event delegation to ensure clicking anywhere on a badge or poster properly opens show details and cleans compound episode IDs.
- **Continue Watching "See All" Details View & Badge Enrichment**:
  - Fixed Continue Watching "See All" page to ensure it groups by show (displaying one card per in-progress show with the main Show Poster rather than raw episode still thumbnails).
  - Filtered out already-watched episodes from Watch History, corrected header button to "Clear All", and ensured unaired badges display cleanly alongside the red (X) remove button.
  - Enriched Continue Watching items (both dashboard shelf and "See All" page) to automatically display "Season Finale" (e.g. *Silo*) and "Finale: [Date]" (e.g. *Reacher*, *Lanterns*) badges for upcoming unaired episodes.
- **JavaScript Syntax Fix**:
  - Resolved `Uncaught SyntaxError` on client-side template string line breaks.
