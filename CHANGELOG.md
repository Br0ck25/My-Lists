## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-28

### 🌟 Highlights & Major Additions
- **Airing Next Calendars for Trakt, MDBList & Simkl**:
  - Personalized upcoming episode calendar catalogs (`trakt:user:shows:airing-next` and `mdblist:user:shows:airing-next`), complementing existing Simkl Airing Next support.
  - Analyzes watched history and watchlists, dynamically checks upcoming episode air dates via TMDB, and sorts series chronologically ascending.
  - Features real-time schedule badges (*"Airs today"*, *"Airs Friday"*, *"Season Premiere"*).
  - Dedicated interactive schedule modal and Stremio/Nuvio list preview.
- **Modern Light / Dark Mode Toggle**:
  - Replaced legacy toggle with an iOS/Wako-styled animated circular switch.
  - Custom SVG iconography (radiant 8-ray sun in dark mode, fine-stroke crescent moon in light mode).
  - Smooth 360-degree rotational & scale transitions.
  - Dynamic `<meta name="theme-color">` synchronization between `#000000` (dark) and `#F2F2F7` (light) for native mobile status bar adaptation.
- **Automated Multi-Source Poster Fallback Engine**:
  - Automatically recovers missing posters for classic, obscure, or indie titles where TMDB's `poster_path` is empty.
  - Three-tier fallback cascade: TMDB High-Res Backdrops &rarr; IMDb ID via Cinemeta & Metahub &rarr; Cinemeta Title Search.
  - Integrated into `/api/title-search`, client image error handlers, and the catalog rendering pipeline.

### ⚡ Search & Discovery Enhancements
- **Multi-Page Search Results**:
  - Keyword title searches now query and aggregate up to 100 relevant results in parallel instead of capping at 20.
- **Real-Time Search Filter Dropdowns**:
  - Added instant client-side dropdown filters for **Genre** (16 categories), **Release Year** (1980s to 2026), and **Rating** (5.0+ to 8.0+).
  - Added star rating badges (`★ 8.4`) directly onto search result posters.
- **Top 20 Default Category Previews**:
  - Opening the Search tab or switching category chips (**Movies**, **Shows**, **Lists**) immediately displays the current Top 20 trending items or top-rated community lists.
  - Community lists are ranked by Likes descending and Item Count descending; empty lists (0 items) are excluded.

### 🛠️ Watchlist & Catalog Fixes
- **MDBList Watchlist Add & Sync**:
  - Fixed mutation endpoint authentication (`Authorization: Bearer` and `x-api-key`) and payload structure for adding/removing watchlist items.
  - Multi-endpoint probing across `/watchlist`, `/watchlist/items`, `/sync/watchlist`, and custom list IDs.
  - Fixed ID extractor to normalize numeric TMDB IDs, IMDb IDs, and nested media objects so no items are discarded.
- **"See All" Full List Details for Mixed Lists**:
  - Fixed `/api/preview` to preserve `type: "mixed"` and per-item media types, allowing mixed catalogs and watchlists to properly display all movies and TV shows across category tabs.
- **Infinite Pagination Fix**:
  - Fixed recommended movies/shows catalogs in Stremio/Nuvio to return empty arrays once personal recommendations are exhausted, preventing endless 500-page loops into generic charts.
- **Clean Poster Layouts**:
  - Removed duplicate release years under catalog shelves in Live Preview for a cleaner poster presentation.
  - Removed ~170 lines of duplicate code in list management utilities.
